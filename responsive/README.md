This assignment took about 1.5 hours to finish.
Discussed this assignment with Titapa Chaiyakiturajai.

I used media queries and the sprite image to create the css file. 
I was unable to connect my local files to my repo at first so many of my initial commit messages were not uploaded to github. I made some additional changes at the end and I committed and pushed them onto github when I connected my local files to my repo.
