This Git repository contains my work for comp20:Web Programming. 

My favority lab/assignment is Assignment 2: MBTA schedule. It was the first time I got to use an API and I learned how easy it is to use yet it has many complex functions. 

Throughout this course,I feel I have grown a lot as a programmer and also as a student. I gained new insights not only how to use the basic tools to create powerful and usefule websites but also on this industry as a whole. I now have a much better idea of the kinds of the work that is produced in this field and the different possibilities I can explore. 

The most important thing I learned in this course is the basics of networking and HTTP protocols. All of our projects involve some understanding of how our computers communicate with other servers and this basic understand helped me work through many assignments. 
On Assignment 2, it was the first time I used the GET method to retreive data from a server. Without the understanding of how the data is retreived from the server, it would have been difficult to complete this assignment.
On lab 8, it was the first time I used both the GET and POST methods to get data and to send data back to the the user. Through this lab, I was able to further understand the importance of knowing these two methods and how important these methods are to the functionalities of a website. 

I would like to dive deeper into web security. It is the last thing we discussed in class but it seems like one of the most useful things to learn more about both for creating a website. I was intrigued by the simple but effective ways to "break" a website and I want to explore more about this topic.
