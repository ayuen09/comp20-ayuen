This Git repository contains my work for comp20:Web Programming. 

My favority lab/assignment is Assignment 2: MBTA schedule. It was the first time I got to use an API and I learned how easy to use yet has many complex functions. 

Throughout this course, I think I learned a lot yet I also feel like I have not learned not much at all. I look at the labs and assignments and see what I have done. While I can use these tools and apply it to different projects, I barely understand how these tools work or how it interacts with other APIs. From day 1 to now, I think I became much more of an active programmer and I learned a lot about the industry through this class.

The most important thing I learned in this course is how to tackle large complicated projects by modularizing into smaller task and accomplishing them with different APIs. I use to be overwhelmed by the complexity and unfamiliarity of a tool but now I have learned to not be intimidated by the task and tackle it step by step. 
*One example of such is Assignment 3. I was unfamiliar with the concepts of databases and how it interacts with the server and clients. I had no idea where to start and was buried with an amount of resources that I do not understand. However, I started to try out different methods and examples I had got from class or from the internet even if I have not yet understood the example. Eventually, working each function one at a time, I acheived the final product
*Another example is with the MBTA assignment. In this assignment, it was the first time I was using an API and I was unfamiliar with it at the time.
